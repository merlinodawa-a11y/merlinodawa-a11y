## Hi there 👋

<!--
**merlinodawa-a11y/merlinodawa-a11y** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hi, I am Merlin Odawa
I'm a first year computer science student
🌱 I’m currently learning C++ programming mainly C++ fundamentals ( variables, data types, loops and conditionals, functions, arrays and vectors, file input/output, basic object-oriented programming) problem solving and algorithmic thinking. I recently made a submission of assignment I was working on on cryptography concepts where I did some decryption and encryption of various key words.
🔭 I’m currently working on C++ console projects including basic calculators (distance, grade, temperature) , mini data processing tasks, file handling exercises and cryptography basics ( Caesar cipher and vigenere cipher). Recently I experinced working in a group where we created a visual digital story where we employed multimedia content in creating coursework.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creating a portfolio that shows how I think as a beginner programmer, how I improve overtime and my interest in programming and later grow into more advanced projects.
- 🤔 I’m am seeking for opportunities that will help me expand my technical experience and contribution to real-world projects; opportunities that allow me togain real experience, support a team and continue developing as a learner.
- 💬 I am still new to this field of computer science but I am determined to keep improving one project at a time. I am currently building small coding projects in C++ and exploring fundamental computing concepts. My goal is to develop strong skills in software development and contribute to meaningful projects tech projects.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I constantly break my codes on purpose just to see what happens. Debugging is basically my second personality.
