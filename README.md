## Hi there 👋

<!--
**merlinodawa-a11y/merlinodawa-a11y** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hi, I am Merlin Odawa
I'm a first year computer science student
🌱 I’m currently learning C++ programming mainly C++ fundamentals ( variables, data types, loops and conditionals, functions, arrays and vectors, file input/output, basic object-oriented programming) problem solving and algorithmic thinking. I recently made a submission of assignment I was working on on cryptography concepts where I did some decryption and encryption of various key words.
🔭 I’m currently working on C++ console projects including basic calculators (distance, grade, temperature) , mini data processing tasks, file handling exercises and cryptography basics ( Caesar cipher and vigenere cipher). Recently I experinced working in a group where we created a visual digital story where we employed multimedia content in creating coursework.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creating a portfolio that shows how I think as a beginner programmer, how I improve overtime and my interest in programming and later grow into more advanced projects.
- 🤔 I’m am seeking for opportunities that will help me expand my technical experience and contribution to real-world projects; opportunities that allow me togain real experience, support a team and continue developing as a learner.
- 💬 I am still new to this field of computer science but I am determined to keep improving one project at a time. I am currently building small coding projects in C++ and exploring fundamental computing concepts. My goal is to develop strong skills in software development and contribute to meaningful projects tech projects. 
In the few weeks that I have studied computer science I have acquired both technical and and soft skills, some of them including basic programming logic (conditions, loops, input/output)
, digital storytelling tools, debugging simple programs and git & github basics ( creating repositories, commits, README files). I also mastered the skill of teamwork, adaptability, creativity and good communication.
My hobbies include building small coding projects, experimenting with apps and gadgets, solving puzzles or challenges, gaming, digital art and photography.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I constantly break my codes on purpose just to see what happens. Debugging is basically my second personality.
