      <h2>Currently Learning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🌱 I’m currently learning C++ programming mainly C++ fundamentals ( variables, data types, loops and conditionals, functions, arrays and vectors, file input/output, basic object-oriented programming) problem solving and algorithmic thinking. I recently made a submission of assignment I was working on on cryptography concepts where I did some decryption and encryption of various key words.🔭 I’m currently working on C++ console projects including basic calculators (distance, grade, temperature) , mini data processing tasks, file handling exercises and cryptography basics ( Caesar cipher and vigenere cipher). Recently I experinced working in a group where we created a visual digital story where we employed multimedia content in creating coursework.</li>
      <li>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creating a portfolio that shows how I think as a beginner programmer, how I improve overtime and my interest in programming and later grow into more advanced projects.
- 🤔 I’m am seeking for opportunities that will help me expand my technical experience and contribution to real-world projects; opportunities that allow me togain real experience, support a team and continue developing as a learner.</li>
        <li>💬 I am still new to this field of computer science but I am determined to keep improving one project at a time. I am currently building small coding projects in C++ and exploring fundamental computing concepts. My goal is to develop strong skills in software development and contribute to meaningful projects tech projects. </li>
